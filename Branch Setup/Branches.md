## What is a Branch? ðŸ¤”
When you want to work on a certain part of a project (e.g new feature), instead of working directly on `main` It's wiser to create another branch and later merge into main once you have fixed any bugs with the new feature. This helps us keep the main branch clean and free of any issues.

## How to create a Branch
1. Then to create the branch use `git branch git-training-firstName`
2. Then to navigate to the branch you just created use `git checkout branch-name`
3. Alternatively you can use `git checkout -b firstName` to create a new branch and navigate to it at the same time(only use for creating new branches).
