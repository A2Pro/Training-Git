# Branches ðŸŒ¿


1. Make sure you are on the master branch by entering `git checkout master`, this will navigate you to the master branch.(use `git checkout <branch-name>` to navigate to different branches.)
2. Then to create the branch use `git branch git-training-firstName-lastInitial`
3. Great!! You just created your first branch. The next you will learn how to stage and commit changes and how to push them to the branch
