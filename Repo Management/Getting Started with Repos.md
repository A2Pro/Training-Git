# Set up a Git Repo

## Cloning a Repository

To work on a project using github you must clone the repository to your local system. This allows you to make changes and experiment with your code without affecting the code on the master branch and any changed you make that cause bugs can just be reverted on your computer.

So to clone this repo follow the link to [the frc-git-training](https://github.com/beranki/frc-git-training) repository and click the green button that says **`<> Code`**. Copy the link presented to you and then open git. In git, to clone a repo you should type `git clone <link to repo>`

## Navigating to the Repo

Use the command `cd "<path where the repo is saved>"`.

Once in the right folder you can move on to the next Activity: [Branch Setup](/Branch%20Setup/).
